Date: 10 April 2020

I implimented model by using spam_or_not_spam.csv data set to predict spam emails. This project is organised as follows:

(a) Extracting data from data set.
(b) preprocessing the data and split for train and test data for given model.
(c) Impliment basic RNN using LSTM layers.
(d) evaluate the performance of model.


spam_or_not_spam.csv: dataset for given model.

Result: 
test loss:0.126240263260901
test accuracy:0.968999981880188
